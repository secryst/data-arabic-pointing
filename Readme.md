# Support Repository for Arabic Diacritization

### data for single words

Diacritizing single arabic words comes sometimes with 
"collisions", i.e. several valid alternatives or existing 
words after diacritization.

##### examples:
- examples with collisions
- examples without collisions 


### NNets models
We also add a directory with trained neural networks for [arabic diacritization](https://github.com/interscript/arabic-diacritization).
In that case, the full path "log_dir/.../model*.pt" had to be copied to the above code, in /python.
